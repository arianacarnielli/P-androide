	abstract = {The information theory developed by Shannon was designed to place a quantitative measure on the amount of information involved in any communication. The early developers stressed that the information measure was dependent only on the probabilistic structure of the communication process. For example, if losing all your assets in the stock market and having whale steak for supper have the same probability, then the information associated with the occurrence of either event is the same. Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker. It is necessary to be concerned not only with the probabilistic nature of the uncertainties that surround us, but also with the economic impact that these uncertainties will have on us.},

	title = {Making {Rational} {Decisions} {Using} {Adaptive} {Utility} {Elicitation}},
	abstract = {Rational decision making requires full knowledge of the utility function of the person affected by the decisions. However, in many cases, the task of acquiring such knowledge is not feasible due to the size of the outcome space and the complexity of the utility elicitation process. Given that the amount of utility information we can acquire is limited, we need to make decisions with partial utility information and should carefully select which utility elicitation questions we ask. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this problem that utilizes a prior probability distribution over the person’s utility function, perhaps learned from a population of similar people. The relevance of a utility elicitation question for the current decision problem can then be measured using its value of information. We propose an algorithm that interleaves the analysis of the decision problem and utility elicitation to allow these two tasks to inform each other. At every step, it asks the utility elicitation question giving us the highest value of information and computes the best strategy based on the information acquired so far, stopping when the expected utility loss resulting from our recommendation falls below a pre-speciﬁed threshold. We show how the various steps of this algorithm can be implemented efﬁciently.},

	abstract = {The task of evaluating and ranking items with multipleattributes appears in many guises in commerce. Examples include evaluating responses to a request for quotes (RFQ) for some item and comparison shopping for an item within one or more catalogs. This task is straightforward if the value of the item can be explicitly speciﬁed by the evaluator as a function of the attribute values. However, a typical evaluator may not be able to provide the value function in explicit form. In contrast, it is intuitive for them to compare, say, two items and pick the preferable one based on all of the relevant attributes. In this paper we present a method, Q-Eval, that queries the evaluator with selected pairs of items and uses the responses to build a preference model for the evaluator. This model is then used to rank the items in order of the inferred preference. The evaluator can then pick the winning item or items by considering only the top few items in this ranked list. This should result in signiﬁcant productivity improvement for the evaluator when the number of items to choose from is large. Our algorithm is novel in the way it attempts to derive a stable preference model with only a small number of user queries. This paper describes the algorithm and presents experimental results with real-life data to validate the approach.},

	abstract = {Preference elicitation is a key problem facing the deployment of intelligent systems that make or recommend decisions on the behalf of users. Since not all aspects of a utility function have the same impact on object-level decision quality, determining which information to extract from a user is itself a sequential decision problem, balancing the amount of elicitation effort and time with decision quality. We formulate this problem as a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Because of the continuous nature of the state and action spaces of this POMDP, standard techniques cannot be used to solve it. We describe methods that exploit the special structure of preference elicitation to deal with parameterized belief states over the continuous state space, and gradient techniques for optimizing parameterized actions. These methods can be used with a number of different belief state representations, including mixture models.},

	abstract = {Structured utility models are essential for the effective representation and elicitation of complex multiattribute utility functions. Generalized additive independence (GAI) models provide an attractive structural model of user preferences, offering a balanced tradeoff between simplicity and applicability. While representation and inference with such models is reasonably well understood, elicitation of the parameters of such models has been studied less from a practical perspective. We propose a procedure to elicit GAI model parameters using only “local” utility queries rather than “global” queries over full outcomes. Our local queries take full advantage of GAI structure and provide a sound framework for extending the elicitation procedure to settings where the uncertainty over utility parameters is represented probabilistically. We describe experiments using a myopic value-of-information approach to elicitation in a large GAI model.},

	title = {Optimal {Recommendation} {Sets}: {Covering} {Uncertainty} over {User} {Preferences}},
	abstract = {We propose an approach to recommendation systems that optimizes over possible sets of recommended alternatives in a decision-theoretic manner. Our approach selects the alternative set that maximizes the expected valuation of the user’s choice from the recommended set. The set-based optimization explicitly recognizes the opportunity for passing residual uncertainty about preferences back to the user to resolve. Implicitly, the approach chooses a set with a diversity of alternatives that optimally covers the uncertainty over possible user preferences. The approach can be used with several preference representations, including utility theory, qualitative preferences models, and informal scoring. We develop a specific formulation for multi-attribute utility theory, which we call maximization of expected max (MEM). We go on to show that this optimization is NP-complete (when user preferences are described by discrete distributions) and suggest two efficient methods for approximating it. These approximations have complexity of the same order as the traditional k-max operator and, for both synthetic and realworld data, perform better than the approach of recommending the k-individually best alternatives (which is not a surprise) and very close to the optimum set (which is less expected).},

	abstract = {Bayesian approaches to utility elicitation typically adopt (myopic) expected value of information (EVOI) as a natural criterion for selecting queries. However, EVOI-optimization is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we examine EVOI optimization using choice queries, queries in which a user is ask to select her most preferred product from a set. We show that, under very general assumptions, the optimal choice query w.r.t. EVOI coincides with the optimal recommendation set, that is, a set maximizing the expected utility of the user selection. Since recommendation set optimization is a simpler, submodular problem, this can greatly reduce the complexity of both exact and approximate (greedy) computation of optimal choice queries. We also examine the case where user responses to choice queries are error-prone (using both constant and mixed multinomial logit noise models) and provide worst-case guarantees. Finally we present a local search technique for query optimization that works extremely well with large outcome spaces.},
